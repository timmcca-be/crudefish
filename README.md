"Comedy" site, built with a WAMP stack in 2015. I really thought this might be the next big thing.
I updated some styling stuff in 2017 (believe it or not, it was worse before), but other than that
this is all from my junior year of high school. I just spun it up on an AWS Lightsail instance;
you can access it [here](https://crudefish.timmcca.be/).
